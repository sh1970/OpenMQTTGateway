Registry
========

.. warning::

   Make sure pilight is not running before editing your configuration or else all changes will be lost.

Besides all the fixed configuration objects, pilight also allows developers to use the integrated registry. This registry allows developers to store information that can later be retrieved when reading the configuration. pilight itself will for example store its current version and available version in the registry and the pilight webGUI will store additional settings in there as well. You are therefore advised to leave the registry untouched so all additional information created by the different webGUIs is not lost.
