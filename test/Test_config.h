/*  
  OpenMQTTGateway  - ESP8266 or Arduino program for home automation 

   Act as a wifi or ethernet gateway between your 433mhz/infrared IR signal  and a MQTT broker 
   Send and receiving command by MQTT
 
  This program enables to:
 - receive MQTT data from a topic and send RF 433Mhz signal corresponding to the received MQTT data
 - publish MQTT data to a different topic related to received 433Mhz signal
 - receive MQTT data from a topic and send IR signal corresponding to the received MQTT data
 - publish MQTT data to a different topic related to received IR signal
 - publish MQTT data to a different topic related to BLE devices rssi signal

 * The following parameters are set during the WifiManager setup process:
 * - wifi_ssid
 * - wifi_password
 * - mqtt_user
 * - mqtt_pass
 * - mqtt_server
 * - mqtt_port
 * 
 * To completely disable WifiManager, define ESPWifiManualSetup.
 * If you do so, please don't forget to set these variables before compiling
 * 
 * Otherwise you can provide these credentials on the web interface after connecting 
 * to the access point with your password (SSID: WifiManager_ssid, password: WifiManager_password)
